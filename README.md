Overview
ViewCorp
This interactive website is the dream of all software corporate teams! Every user has the ability to create folders and share them among their peers. By simply typing someone’s email, they will have access to that folder within their dashboard, which is user-specific. Inside these folders, users can perform many collaborative operations. From requesting feedback on scripts to rating others’ work, ViewCorp lets the voice of every employee in every company be heard.
Organization is crucial in every working environment. Therefore, ViewCorp makes sure every script is inside a unique folder. These folders can be accessed by or created by every user and can be sorted by name. As mentioned above, every uploaded document can have ratings and comments.
